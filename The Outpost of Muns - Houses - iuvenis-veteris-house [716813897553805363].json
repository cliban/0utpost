He lost track since his 5th missed birthday....though...maybe today...he’ll come home.......but, that was the case for yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that......he’s starting to forget what he looks like....the only remedy being that family picture, when everything was okay.....and Dad.....Iuvenis felt a tear drop down as he sat.\n\nHe wanted a pet....maybe it’d be less lonely around here then..",
