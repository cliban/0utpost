This also affects her voice.\nPersonality: Ketsuban is quite distant to pretty much everyone and constantly gives short answers to things to most people. She also seems really tired. She constantly is in fear of her own glitchy state, hating her usual mun form to the point that she hides as other muns as to not cause it to spread. She constantly feels she has to be extremely careful as to not break something or someone.\nSpecial Power: She's kinda glitchy, which means she can no-clip through stuff sometimes,as well as things that really shouldn't happen happening.. However, the downside of this is that it can also affect other muns or places temporarily.",
